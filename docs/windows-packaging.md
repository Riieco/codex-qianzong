# Windows Packaging

## Read When

- Before changing Windows installer, WebView2 assumptions, icons, signing, or release commands.

## Owner

- Desktop / Release

## Update Trigger

- Bundle targets, Tauri config, installer metadata, signing, or Windows shell behavior changes.

## Validation

- `npm run tauri build` succeeds on Windows and generated installer launches the app.

## Requirements

- Node.js 24+
- Rust 1.92+
- Microsoft WebView2 runtime
- Tauri CLI via local npm dev dependency

## Commands

```powershell
npm install
npm run build
npm run rust:check
npm run tauri build
```

## Expected Artifacts

Tauri writes Windows artifacts under:

```text
src-tauri/target/release/bundle/
```

The GitHub Actions installer workflow builds the x64 MSI explicitly and uploads:

```text
codex-qianzong_1.5.2_x64.msi
```

Local `npm run tauri build` may also produce an NSIS `.exe`, depending on the installed Tauri bundler support.

## Runtime Behavior

- Global shortcut: `Ctrl+Alt+U`
- Tray left click toggles the window.
- Tray menu can show/hide, toggle topmost, and quit.
- Window is transparent and borderless with custom UI controls.

## Release Notes

- `src-tauri/icons/icon.ico` is generated from `Resources/codexU-icon.png`.
- Code signing is not configured in source; add signing through release secrets or local build environment.
